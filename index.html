                Hello everyone! 
                Let me introduce myself first to know me better.
                My name is Rachelita Embun Safira. Most of my friends call me Rachel. I'm from Temanggung, one of the district in Central Java. I'm 20 years old. Now, I'm a student of Yogyakarta State University in Informatic Engineering study program. Now, I'm in the fourth semester of study.
                My hobbies are drawing, listen to music, and I like to watch movies lately. Beside that, Iâ€™m so much interest with Informatic, so I love to learn about that.

                <span>ABOUT HOBBIES</span>
                I like to listen to music from some generation, and countries. Music genre that I like are pop (of course), jazz-pop, blues, middle rock, etc.
                My favorite musicians are John Mayer, Coldplay, The Beatles, etc. Meanwhile, I like to draw to kill my boring time. When I was in Elementary School, I had ever joined a drawing class. But lately, during the pandemic, mostly I use my holiday to watch some movie, from K-drama, Hollywood, Series, etc.
